==============================================================

The src folder is haXe source code with a simple sample(under app folder), and bin is the compile result.

You can just use make command both under Windows and Linux to compile hatalyst :

make (or make build): just compile and build a release version of the site , and trace will disable in the result.

make debug : compile a site for test and debug .

make clean : remove all compiled site file .

If you want's to test the sample, you must change your /etc/hosts file, parse the zhhost domain to 127.0.0.1 . under windows, this file will be C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. Then config your apache to point the host directory to the bin folder or copy the content in bin folder to the host directory. Then open http://localhost in your browser you can see the result.

Document will comming soon.

src目錄中是haXe源碼，包含一個簡單的例子（在src/app目錄下），bin目錄則是編譯結果。

在Windows下和Linux下都可以使用make命令编译框架：

make(或 make build): 编译发布版本，在编译结果中，程序中的trace语句将会失效。

make debug: 编译调试版本，trace语句也可以使用。

make clean: 清除编译结果。

如果想要測試例子，你必須修改/etc/hosts（Windows下爲C:\Windows\System32\etc\hosts）檔案，將zhhost解析爲127.0.0.1。再修改apache的配置，將網站目錄指向bin目錄，或將bin目錄中的內容拷貝到網站目錄中。最後在瀏覽器中打開http://localhost就能看到結果了。

文檔將很快加入。
